At approximately 1,200 meters above sea level, the 1,854 hectare property has an average annual rainfall of 1,200 mm, highly fertile volcanic basalt soils, pristine spring fed, year-round natural waterways, including five waterfalls. It is a unique environment for growing cattle.\n\nPrior to the commencement of Wilmot Cattle Company operations in 2008, the property had been conventionally managed. In 2013, a property transformation began, adopting regenerative and holistic management practices and resulting in significant gains in the overall ecological health of the farm.\n\nToday the property is managed in an intensive rotationally-grazed system with small numbers of large mobs moving across the landscape, mimicking nature, to create ecological change and improve landscape health and biological function. At shovel depth, our soil organic carbon (SOC) has improved from ~2.5% to >4.5%, with a goal of getting it to >6% by 2023.",

In order to mirror natural herding behaviors, time controlled rotational grazing optimizes the number of stock in a paddock, matches the grazing period with available pasture, shortens grazing periods in each paddock, and follows these activities by long resting periods to allow the pasture to recover. When managed well, this grazing system increases groundcover, biomass, plant diversity, animal and plant nutrition, soil health, water infiltration and soil organic carbon. A more complete explanation of the science, monitoring tools and management practices is provided below.",
